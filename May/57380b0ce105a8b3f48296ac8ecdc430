The national conversation has only recently shifted toward talk about rape culture and violence on women&#8217;s bodies. This was following the horrific murder of Karabo Mokoena, allegedly by her partner. Universities have been speaking about rape culture, calling on authorities to pay attention to and take action against rape culture. In the past week, three South African universities have protested the silence of their universities management who allow rape culture to be perpetuated.The University of the Western Cape (UWC) &#8211; #KhangaUWCStudents at UWC are calling out their university s apathy, accusing management of ignorance and neglecting rape and sexual violence cases.UWC students started a movement called Khanga UWC to end rape culture on their campus.Khanga is a collective whose objective is to obtain justice, end rape culture, assault and all other forms of violence + #ENDRAPECULTURE (@KhangaUWC) April 1, 2017Khanga refers to a poem written by Fezeka Khuzwayo, or Khwezi, who accused President Zuma of rape in 2005. In April 2008, Zuma was found not guilty of raping her. Khwezi performed her poem, I am Khanga, wearing khanga (a traditional cloth) at the opening of the exhibition &#8220;Identity, Power and Connection&#8221;, at the Afrovibes Festival in The Netherlands that year.The #KhangaUWC movement comes in the wake of #3days4girls which refers to the instance where four women were sexually assaulted at UWC from April 22 to April 24. Students had said the university was silent on the matter: that no communications had been sent out, and that management only responded to students when fees were outstanding or students caused damage on campus.Students protested again on Friday, 12 May, under #KhangaUWC, following an incident on Saturday, May 6 when a third year student was raped by an unknown man. CCTV footage shows the man stalking and following the woman into a campus bathroom. The student came forward about her rape to the Cape Times.Khanga UWC End Rape Campaign.

Chole said management is doing nothing to combat rape.The problem has been ongoing. Last year, Edu-Drama had received accounts of sexual assault and rape on campus. The students held a Rape Culture protest last year and brought issues to management, who failed to respond adequately.UWC spokesperson Luthando Tyhalibongo said there are security measures in place and that the university has taken action against those perpetrators of sexual violence. Tyhalibongo also said a reference group was set up by the task team for consultations.Take a closer look at this powerful statement#UWCRAPIST #KhangaUWC #KaraboMokoena #EndRapeCulture pic.twitter.com/qsOuEtpWKU super satan (@HusaynBassier) May 12, 2017Students donned black and demonstrated on campus holding up placards. They marched around campus, stopping outside the pub that the woman who had been raped in the bathroom was walking back from. Students were silent, to highlight the silence from management and the lack of repercussions for rapists.#KhangaUWC#IAm1in3#RapeAtUWC pic.twitter.com/Xlgb4oPG4K #ENDRAPECULTURE (@KhangaUWC) May 12, 2017Protesters called on men to rise up against rape culture.#UwcRapist Its high time Men #RiseUp &amp; protect Our Mothers,Sisters&amp;Daughters @MbalulaFikile #KhangaUWC #MenAreTrash pic.twitter.com/Tc7ADMcc4A Oscar Alochi (@papafavour) May 12, 2017University of Pretoria (UP) &#8211; #UPResCrisisOn Tuesday UP students UP demonstrated on the university s Hatfield campus against rape culture.

Spokesperson Rikus Delport said that a process of engagement was already underway since last year to improve awareness. Delport also said the university would not hesitate to take action against perpetrators. The safety of our students and staff remains our highest priority, he said.#UPRapeCrisis protest today. Security personnel was more concerned about who put up bras and underwear at the CSC. Not about the rape cases. pic.twitter.com/mcCgzgh5UN Babes Womzabalazo (@NalediChirwa) May 16, 2017Clearly, the protesters were onto something when they called rape culture out on campus that day.Hours after the protest on Tuesday night, social media erupted when pictures surfaced of men at UP holding posters with misogynistic and offensive slogans. The posters were held up during a Serrie residence dance performance and were meant to distract the women performers.Some of the posters read: Spit or swallow , I m not Asian but I ll eat your cat , Nice thigh gap, can I fill it? and Show us your tits .We see this year after year at TUKS RES. This is how rape culture is formed and nurtured. @eNCA @News24_Pretoria @Beeld_Nuus @SABCNewsOnline pic.twitter.com/eHmcC0pcTB Kwena Moloto (@Kwena_94) May 17, 2017Some students dismissed it as res culture but folks on social media were disgusted. Democratic Alliance spokesperson Phumzile Van Damme, and others, questioned whether UP and its students understood that they were complicit in perpetuation of rape culture and sexism by turning a blind eye to the res culture .See Fez the Photographer&#8217;s page for more on @UPTuks &#8220;Serrie&#8221; culture.
