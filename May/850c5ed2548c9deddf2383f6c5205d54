Our understanding at this stage is that they wanted to seriously hold this event. Exactly what their aim was, and what the content of the meeting was, will form part of the continued investigation, said Viljoen.In a statement released on Wednesday, condemned the act, saying it would not allow any event promoting racial superiority to take place on campus. It also said that the posters were put up without the consent or knowledge of the university. It asked students to allow the investigation to take its course and said it would communicate all findings and further steps to the university community.According to Viljoen, the individuals identified have thus far given statements but the university still needed to speak to the main organiser .
