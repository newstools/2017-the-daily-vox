14:15 PM It has started now, it s on, says Malema at the end of his speech.&#8220;When you leave here, go back home peacefully in a disciplined manner, mobilise, go back into communities, you must have small demonstrations in your own communities, you must demand that Zuma must go &#8230; You must go and stand on bridges even if you are four, even if you are five [protesters], you must hold a placard [saying] Zuma must go.&#8221;Even though the official programme was not quite over, protesters immediately started to leave the Union Building lawns.Guess it&#8217;s over. That was anticlimactic.We&#8217;ll keep you posted if anything changes.XOXO The Daily Vox Team14:00 PM EFF leader Julius Malema took the opportunity to needle Zuma, saying Zuma should go back to the village . It would be a waste of time to present a memorandum to an illiterate someone who doesn t have a relationship with books and therefore a memorandum will not be read by this clown occupying this office. We don t want to waste anyone s time and we don t want to waste paper and ink because this man will never read anything from us. As for plans after this march is done? &#8220;This is a rolling mass action, Malema said, adding that the protests would be going to every province.13:45 PMNotably absent from the podium is DA leader Mmusi Maimane. Instead, spokesperson Phumzile Van Damme led the crowd in a rendition of &#8220;Unity&#8217;s the power&#8221;.Mmusi must tell us why as leader of the opposition, he was not at today&#8217;s march #OppositionMarch.

They plan to hand over a memorandum once they arrive.Police are keeping a close eye on the marchers, and say they are expecting 10 000 people to take part.
