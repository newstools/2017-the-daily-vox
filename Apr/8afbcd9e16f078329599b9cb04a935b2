South Africans were out in their numbers to protest against President Jacob Zuma on Friday. While the streets might have been filled with diverse crowds calling for Number 1 to step down, there was an overwhelming number of people on the streets who were clearly new to protests. The Daily Vox team rounds up the protesters who clearly didn t listen when we told them to learn Senzeni Na.1. Ah, the Model C kids. It s good to know that war cry practice for sports day taught you something valuable. Glad the war cry practice is coming in handy. #AntiZumaMarches https://t.co/pEJ4zAusvB The Daily VOX (@thedailyvox) April 7, 20172. When words (and struggle songs) escape you, you can always fall back on the simple act of clapping.Some sort of clapping ritual now going on outside Parliament. #AntiZumaMarches #AntiZumaMarch #SAunites #PeoplesMarch #Outa. @News24 pic.twitter.com/XLxzoaBjLP Paul Herman (@PaulTHerman) April 7, 20173.

These tannies might have some sick moves but they could have come up with a more creative chant than Zuma must go? We have to admit, it s pretty catchy though. In fact, we can t seem to get it out our heads. (Send help.)Turn up! Turn up! Turn up! pic.twitter.com/GuzEamUWAG $andile Nkabinde (@SandiNkabi) April 7, 20176. We ve heard Zuma being compared to many things, but Butternut Kop is really something. These protesters are clearly not above schoolyard taunts.&#8220;Zuma must fall! Butternut kop! Zuma must fall!&#8221; sings one lively protester #AntiZumaMarches #AntiZumaMarch #SAunites #PeoplesMarch. @News24 pic.twitter.com/8AqlZzR5Hi Paul Herman (@PaulTHerman) April 7, 2017There are more protests to come. Just remember, iYoh Solomon is a hit for a reason, and there aren t even that many lyrics. Again, it&#8217;s not too late to brush up.
