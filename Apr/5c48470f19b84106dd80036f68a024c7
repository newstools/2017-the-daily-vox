The Mail &amp; Guardian and HuffPostSA had some biblical banter ahead of Easter weekend and it s pretty hilarious. It all started when a reader tweeted saying it was confusing that both publications were releasing Easter editions by people who have previously written for both publications.so confusing when huffpo and m&amp;g are both doing religious specials for easter written by people u&#8217;ve read in both pic.twitter.com/cnCuFmj5A0 neo (@_maditla) April 13, 2017The M&amp;G responded saying, Beware false prophets in the last days, to which HuffPostSA responded with, For with what judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with the measure you use, it will be measured back to you. And so it began.via GIPHYHere s how it went down.Beware false prophets in the last days https://t.co/p6nmhJPcYa Mail &amp; Guardian (@mailandguardian) April 13, 2017For with what judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with the measure you use, it will be measured back to you. https://t.co/qJQfIdMen4 HuffPost SouthAfrica (@HuffPostSA) April 13, 2017For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? https://t.co/spvEKrqTYp Mail &amp; Guardian (@mailandguardian) April 13, 2017And the Lord s servant must not be quarrelsome but must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful. https://t.co/QDQnJdt4FR HuffPost SouthAfrica (@HuffPostSA) April 13, 2017&#8220;It has been said, &#8216;You shall not test the Lord your God.'&#8221; #MGGodEdition https://t.co/b9Em4l3U1Q Mail &amp; Guardian (@mailandguardian) April 13, 2017And he said to them, Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to the whole creation. #FaithAndSpirituality https://t.co/zDLwP4JuyM HuffPost SouthAfrica (@HuffPostSA) April 13, 2017And then it was over. We&#8217;re thinking they either had to get on with their day jobs or they ran out of suitable scriptures to quote.Happy Easter everyone! #StayBlessed #MGGodEdition #FaithAndSpirituality https://t.co/WIg7GJtLnL Mail &amp; Guardian (@mailandguardian) April 13, 2017Us too!
