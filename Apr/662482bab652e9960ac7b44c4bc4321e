Mass action is expected ahead of plans to bring the country to a standstill on Friday 7 April. This comes after President Zuma s highly contentious cabinet reshuffle last week where he fired five ministers &#8211; including finance minister Pravin Gordhan &#8211; and switched a few more. Since then, South Africans have been seething and different groupings have planned action to force Zuma to step down.Tensions are running high and the marches could turn violent after reports that 600 Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) members have flown up from Durban vowing to defend ANC headquarters, Luthuli House from enemy forces . Provincial chairperson of the MK, Themba Mavundla, had not confirmed whether the members would be armed, and said they would lay down their lives to protect the ANC and its president.The group that&#39;s just arrived #LuthuliHouse pic.twitter.com/Fk1zhy9ckb&mdash; Sikelelwa Mdingi (@SikiGeyaMdingi) April 7, 2017There are four protests planned in Gauteng today, two of which are expected to draw major crowds.Save South Africa and Outa have organised a march in Pretoria, called the People s March .
