South Africans are unhappy. This we know. Over the next few weeks it looks like we ll be seeing wide-scale protests throughout South Africa covering a range of issues, but particularly calling for the resignation of President Jacob Zuma.It s been a heavy and serious month, so in light of the fact that folk will likely be out on the streets with similar posters &#8211; ZumaMustFall , SAMustRise etc, (which can get boring and repetitive), The Daily Vox team has some advice on how to create the perfect protest placard.1. Make sure that your sign is emotive &#8211; the world needs to know how you re feeling.2. Even if your feelings are more toned down than others.3. Try to be literal and assertive &#8211; show your commitment to the cause.4. But not too literal.5. Your frustration is valid. We could be doing much better things.6. Even protests can be fun and creative. Props and puns? Always winners.7. Keep it simple. People don t always have time to read essays.8. But big words aren t always bad.9. Don t be a sign conformist. Critique the commodification of outrage, even in your outrage!10. And remember to watch your language. There might be children around &#8211; so keep it PG (as in suitable for children, not Pravin Gordhan).
