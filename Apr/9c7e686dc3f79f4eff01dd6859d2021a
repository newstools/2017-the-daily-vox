March looked promising &#8211; and then nosedived pretty badly towards its end. First Helen Zille defended colonialism, and then the great Uncle Kathy passed. As a cherry on top, President Zuma also decided to reshuffle most of the entire cabinet on the eve of the last day of the month, which sent the rand &#8211; and all of our nerves &#8211; all over the place. But it wasn&#8217;t all gloom and doom, we promise. Here&#8217;s the March 2017 edition of ten reasons South Africa doesn&#8217;t suck right now.1. Graduation seasonThe conclusion of the first quarter of the year sees many South African tertiary institutions holding their graduation ceremonies for the class of 2016 and this crop has got a good dose of black excellence. We love to see people shining and thriving. Well done to the graduates!https://twitter.com/ntaoleng_l/status/8474638103989452812. Khayelitsha&#8217;s spinach king is thrivingLufefe Nomjana, the Spinach King, is successfully running his healthy food business in Cape Town&#8217;s Khayelitsha, selling fresh juices and smoothies made with spinach. Muffins are R7, sandwiches and smoothies are priced at around R15; and the Popeye Wrap goes for R30. About his motivation for starting the business, Lumjana says there are a couple of reasons. &#8220;Everything was unhealthy the food, drugs, gangsterism, even the water. I remember a friend of mine having this weird bloated tummy. We thought nothing of it until we later found out that he actually suffered from kwashiorkor, which leads back to nutrition. From then on, I told myself that I wanted to change the environment and myself, he told Destiny Man.Lufefe Nomjana is Kayelitsha&#39;s Spinach King, baking bread &amp; making smoothies, introducing a healthy lifestyle in the township @BBCWorld pic.twitter.com/kgq6XFbyO6&mdash; Lerato Mbele (@BBCLerato) March 23, 20173.

The cop boogieing her way as she directed trafficDorah Mofokeng is no ordinary traffic cop. The Johannesburg Metro Police Officer was captured dancing on video while directing traffic at the intersection of Cedar and Witkoppen Roads in Fourways, and thought she would get fired &#8211; not get the positive response that she has. I am not a dancer but when I am directing traffic at a traffic point everyone must be happy. They must know I am here she told Sowetan Live.Whether they are quickly going shopping or anywhere else they must know there is someone standing there so I put [a] smile on [my] face. Even if they don t want to smile at least I make sure they smile. 5.

The Holy Trinity Catholic Church is safe space for the LGBTQIA+ refugee communityThe Braamfontein church is no stranger to being an inclusive space for marginalised groups, functioning as a safe space and place of refuge during the 2016. And now, it also hosts a support group for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) African refugees. &#8220;The idea of the group was to give a home where people could meet and find some fellowship Where we can integrate faith and being gay, says founder Dumisani Dube, the 35-year-old leader of the support group. &#8220;That was eight years ago and the space is thriving today.&#8221;
