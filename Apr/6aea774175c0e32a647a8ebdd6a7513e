Well-known South African YouTubers Renaldo Gouws and Sibu Mpanza had a pretty intense Twitter feud this week. Gouws apparently sub-tweeted Mpanza in a video, calling him a fame chaser and a liar, among other things. Mpanza took offence and called Gouws out on Twitter. Gouws claims the video was not about Mpanza and was touched at being called a salty white male . And so the feud began.So, here s the lowdown. There s Renaldo Gouws: mediocre white YouTube vlogger with 30 000-odd subscribers and also a DA councillor in PE. Gouws is one of the top 100 YouTubers in South Africa in terms of subscribers, comments, likes and watch time.Then there s Sibu Mpanza: a lesser-known YouTube vlogger with under 4 000 subscribers; young, black, vocal and doing the things. Despite Gouws being a higher ranking vlogger, he isn t endorsed by any brands whereas Mpanza is working with Takealot and Standard Bank. He also previously worked with Jameson. Shame, neh?Social media marketer, Aasia Fredericks, told The Daily Vox that brands assess the content vloggers produce, the markets they appeal to as well as the level of interaction their videos garner. Fredericks said preference is given to young, black South Africans because most brands are aiming at a young black target market. If that&#8217;s not your audience, you lose out.On Monday, Gouws made a video titled Being a South African YouTuber where, among other things, he threw shade on smaller South African vloggers who claim to have quit their jobs and studies because they are rolling in the dough . He said small SA vloggers are blatantly lying about how much they earn, when in actual fact they can t even afford to buy Oros at the end of the month &#8211; which is low-key racist by the way.Gouws claims they are wannabe celebrities who are pretentious and would say or do anything to be famous. As a top YouTuber , Gouws claims to know the realities of vlogging in South Africa where it is impossible to make a living solely off YouTube and just wishes these fame-chasers with 4 000 subscribers or less in South Africa would also realise that . For Gouws, it is disingenuous to claim otherwise because it creates a false sense of security among local vloggers.It was obvious for Mpanza and everyone else that Gouws had just subtweeted him.He basically named me.3 to 4k subscribers. 1K views per video. Dropped out of varsity. Making money. https://t.co/cGhp0k68iq Mpanza (@Sibu_MpanzaSA) April 4, 2017That s when things got lit.Mpanza tweeted about the salty white male who subbed him in a video.Here&#8217;s the the video of a rather salty white male subbing me in a YouTube video for making money on YT. WARNING, you might fall asleep https://t.co/o5kgLHXUZ9 Mpanza (@Sibu_MpanzaSA) April 4, 2017And the Twitterverse responded. Mpanza s followers and subscribers jumped to his defence, calling Gouws out on his white male privilege.I felt worms running up my spine. All the things wrong w/ entitled white males. https://t.co/8FfRvULhw1 Quem quaeritis? (@BanNgidi) April 4, 2017He gets waaaay more views than me. He&#8217;s mad that it doesn&#8217;t mean he gets paid for it. https://t.co/6izQcuJd9N Mpanza (@Sibu_MpanzaSA) April 4, 2017This bro really TRIED it taking a swipe at @Sibu_MpanzaSA. WHY do you suppose we care?

When I called him out he blocked me. Sub hunting&#8230; But hey, if the shoe fits&#8230; pic.twitter.com/cO5c0lFmTK Renaldo Gouws (@RenaldoGouws) April 4, 2017As with most twars, we can never be sure who blocked who first.But then Gouws took it to a whole new level. He tweeted Mpanza s sponsors asking if they want to be associated with someone who has a problem with white people.Clearly this guy has a problem with white people. Just look at his tweets. Classy new ambassador you have in Sibu Mphanza, @JamesonSA. pic.twitter.com/eZ3fOZ2vXT Renaldo Gouws (@RenaldoGouws) April 4, 2017Jameson denied that Mpanza was their brand ambassador, and said Mpanza only worked with them once-off.@Ongetiteld @RenaldoGouws Jameson does not stand for any form of discrimination. Sibu is not a Jameson brand ambassador &amp; does not speak on behalf of the brand. Jameson South Africa (@JamesonSA) April 4, 2017Of course, Gouws rode on that one saying that Mpanza is a liar who faked being Jameson s brand ambassador.Just for the record, You know, because all the hate was aimed at me. He lied to you all. He was never a Brand Ambassador #WeStandWithSibu pic.twitter.com/CIhKD2Ri4z Renaldo Gouws (@RenaldoGouws) April 5, 2017Takealot responded to Gouws saying that Mpanza s views are his own and that they do not support any form of racial discrimination.@RenaldoGouws Sibu joined us on a recent campaign.Any views he expresses are his own.He doesn&#8217;t speak for us &amp; we don t support any form of discrimination takealot (@TAKEALOT) April 5, 2017Mpanza responded that he has always been vocal about race and class; surely his sponsors knew who they were getting involved with when they decided to work with him?Dude. Stop. You&#8217;re embarrassing yourself.All brands know how I tweet, instagram, create any content. There are no surprises here. https://t.co/PZTOgLuhlG Mpanza (@Sibu_MpanzaSA) April 4, 2017Fredericks said she looked into the social media spat and it didn&#8217;t implicate Mpanza in any way because all he did was speak about &#8220;a white boy that doesn&#8217;t know how to use his privilege.&#8221; It would be different if he tweeted a picture with an disreputable person who was publicly known as discriminatory. Now whether Mpanza was subbed or not, there s an issue here. A white male vlogger, encased in his privilege, is publicly destroying the image of a smaller black vlogger. Twarring with, shading and dragging each other is one thing, but when you alert the sponsors and brand ambassadors of another vlogger, you re interfering with their bread.For Gouws, YouTube is all fun and games: he said it himself &#8211; he gives his YouTube money to charity. Hey, he has his white privilege and a job as a DA councillor to fall back on. It s all good. But, and he mentioned in his video, other vloggers rely on YouTube for their livelihoods. (Vloggers, like, say Sibu Mpanza?) If Gouws is as concerned with the growth of young SA vloggers, as he claims to be, why is he trying to drag Mpanza &#8211; who he himself says is a small vlogger &#8211; through the mud?
