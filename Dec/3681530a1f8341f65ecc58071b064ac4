On Wednesday, advocacy organisation Right2Know (R2K) Gauteng picketed outside three military bases in Gauteng against the evictions of Marievale community members who have been residing on the abandoned base for many years. In a statement, R2K say that the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) have illegally evicted residents, as the Johannesburg High Court granted an interim interdict to stop the SANDF from continuing the evictions last month. “R2K has pleaded with the department of defence to intervene and hold the commanding officers responsible but our cry fell on deaf ears. We are also concerned about the lack of accountability and the apparent impunity of members of SANDF, the commanding officers, the department of defence and ultimately, minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula who has not said a word about this gross violation of human rights,” the statement said. Community leader Tumi Weyi who was at the Dunnottar Military Base picket, told the Daily Vox that over 600 people had been evicted by the SANDF, with at least 300 of them being women and children. Unil the case returns to the court on the 29th of January 2018, the Marievale community will continue to reside on land 300m away from the Marievale military base. R2K has put out a call for donations to aid the community during this time. “We are appealing to fellow South Africans to kindly donate tents and/or waterproofing materials, blankets, mattresses, food parcels, water, sanitary facilities, sanitary towels, toiletries, clothes (including warm and waterproof clothing),” said R2K.
