A video that s gone viral locally has us all wanting to hear more &#8211; wondering whether her cooking is as good as her vocals.While her singing talent is blowing people away, her witty lyrics are just as spicy: Darling I will be cooking you food till I m 70. And baby my food will be tasting as good at 83. And I m thinking about how people fall in love with my food every day, baby it s all just in my hands. Since releasing the video, which has been shared over 4 000 times on Facebook, she says her restaurant has been unable to keep up with the inflow of customers. I ve been swamped and overwhelmed with the response. And I m the only chef there so I haven t had much time to breathe, she said, adding that people are now approaching her to do private and corporate events.After hearing those vocals, we ve no doubt people aren t just interested in her cooking. But, as it turns out, Annalakshmi has talents other than singing and cooking &#8211; she s also a stand up comedian. So that accent I was using is part of my persona, called Annalakshmi. I speak with with an exaggerated accent and I give my take on South Africa. The best part is she s never actually had formal training.Annalakshmi says her dream is to pursue a singing career, and is inspired by the likes of Ryan the DJ, Sketchy Bongo and Black Coffee.All we know is we want to hear more.
