So our country has a new Miss South Africa, but last night&#8217;s beauty pageant came against some criticisms which have us questioning what standards of beauty the organisers subscribe to.The first (white) Miss South Africa was crowned in 1943 but we only got a black Miss SA in 1993. #ThankYouApartheid.It&#8217;s time to meet your Top 12 South Africa. Welcome to the 59th annual Miss South Africa pageant. It&#8217;s showtime&#8230; pic.twitter.com/mly4KYOCEx Miss South Africa (@Official_MissSA) March 26, 2017Some South Africans saw it a waste of time. They pointed out that there were more important things to focus on.Forget #MissSA2017 Forget #DateMyFamily Forget #OurPerfectWedding jongani price ye Oros. This is a matter of national importance pic.twitter.com/4klO86N8wH Svigy Veggies (@SivMatho) March 26, 2017Others questioned the elitist and exclusive nature of the event. If it s a national competition, why was it only broadcast on DSTV, they asked.This is not Miss DSTV it&#8217;s #MissSA2017 and hence it should play on SABC for all SAns to watch pic.twitter.com/7uSJvNyitK Bongekile (@Bongeh_M) March 26, 2017The Miss South Africa pageant isn t considered progressive enough by some South Africans. The type of women that are successful in this competition tend to be tall, skinny, and have long, flowing locks &#8211; whether weaves, extensions, or their own hair.The day i see a black girl with Natural hair in the top 12 il support Miss SA #MissSA2017 KEA (@IRep_Kea) March 26, 2017However, some tweeps see this image as the idea of perfection.#MissSA2017 The ladies are stunning, they are beautiful specimens true divine beings, definition of what perfection is!!!! Mpho Brutus (@OfficialMoswagg) March 17, 2017There were comments about how the winner, Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters looks like a mix of former Miss South Africas. So, more of the same then?Demi looks like a mix of @melindabam and @RoleneStrauss &#8211; gorgeous! #misssa2017 https://t.co/zL4n2ol4Q9 Jo-Ann Strauss (@jo_annstrauss) March 26, 2017Demi Leigh is Rolene Strauss doppleganger. We are going to win Miss World AGAIN #misssa2017 pic.twitter.com/uPPr82c6gN Issa KING (@Gobusamang_25) March 26, 2017Issues about representation of different &#8216;looks&#8217; also came up in discussion.I wonder,do black contestants stand a lesser chance of winning if they come out with short hair, afro or dreadlocks? #MissSA2017 Mr rE d-S tt r (@MuanoMusetha) March 26, 2017I&#8217;ve always wanted to enter #MissSA2017 but it&#8217;s for petite women. I feel like it&#8217;s not a full representation of how SA women look Kutlwano Motshegoa (@tlwano_043) March 26, 2017Beauty pageants are an archaic mode of women s empowerment. Why are we still looking at smart beautiful women with a proclivity for philanthropy as something that is exceptional? The fact that they are celebrating a certain type of woman shows that pageant organisers aren t concerned with women in general, but only with selecting a supermodel who happens to be eloquent and clever too.Next year we wanna see afros, cornrows, beads , albinos , make-up free girls. In fact we want it all! #MissSA2017 pic.twitter.com/ubbhgG7e5P Miss Mkhize (@missmkhizexo) March 26, 2017 Is there still a place for beauty pageants in society? Is the lack of representation in the pageant something that needs to be looked at, and changed? Or can beauty pageants be reclaimed and subverted to mean more than picking the most beautiful woman in the country?
