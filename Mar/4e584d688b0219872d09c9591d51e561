It was described as the impossible. And that&#8217;s exactly what they achieved.In the first leg in the round of 16 against Paris Saint Germain (PSG) on February 14, the Catalans looked as if their best days had long gone. They were slow, unenthused and even unimaginative &#8211; not the kind of words you&#8217;d use to describe a team comprising Lionel Messi or Andres Iniesta.But they were that bad that night, and caught a hiding. PSG smashed them 4-0.And just like that, Barcelona&#8217;s dream of taking the Champions League shrivelled up, and left to die on a Parisian sidewalk.But come Wednesday evening, in the return leg at Camp Nou, and Barcelona did indeed show us what they are made of.The best turnaround ever in football bar none #Barca Rio Ferdinand (@rioferdy5) March 8, 2017They scored three goals in the last seven minutes sealing a 6-1 win on the night.
