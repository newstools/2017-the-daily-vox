In the wake of the passing of Ahmed Kathrada, Anglican priest and Dean of Cape Town Anglican communion Michael Weeder penned a poem commemorating Kathrada&#8217;s life.Ahmed Kathrada: 1929 &#8211; 2017Tender love has been your shield and courage your apron of servanthood.Your soul, once awash with longing for comrades who shared with youthe frugal feasts of your island fort,now rest unburdened of the weight of care that led you to the certainty of prison.You returned to the streets of struggle in the spring of our revolution your heart embalmed with the will and strength of the Almighty.With a mystic&#8217;s grace you embraced the shaming contradictions of unfulfilled promises,and pursued the discipleship of mind and body undeterred by the clamour of glory and the lure of the Sabbath of the veteran.Sweet, gentle brother of the people, you leave us, strengthened by your kindness your fearless reprimand of the soul self-evictees. Those led by the morally blind.Rest in the certainty that you leave us beatified by your exemplary witnessas we gather, unbowed, against the merchants of greed in this season of reckoning and gathered resolve.Michael Weeder via Facebook Image via Ahmed Kathrada Foundation
